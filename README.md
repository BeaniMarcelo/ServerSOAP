Hi, this is a project created toi learn more about WebServices and SOAP protocol. 

Project Functionallity:
- Get a SOAP command with 3 parameters (ID, name, CardNumber);
- Send the XML via ISS localhost to the Code;
- The code saves the data on a SQL Database and returns if the save was successfull;
- The code can also receive a xml file and return the list of users from the BD;
